# TCPGeckoSharp
.NET assembly that lets you access and use TCPGecko.

> I know that you can just use the 3 files from Gecko dNet and make your program more portable but this is easier for those who are too lazy to open each of the 3 files and edit 1-2 word(s).

> Also, credits to the creator of Gecko dNet for the original source.
